# Generative-Design-for-Laser-Microrings

Modified to do joint prediction of time-dependent noise on single-channel image generation and parameters.

Install according to requirements.txt, then run train.py to train a diffusion model, and train_predictor.py to train a predictor model.

To generate new images and parameters, run generate.py.
