# Generative-Design-for-Laser-Microrings

Modified to do joint prediction of time-dependent noise on single-channel image generation and parameters.
WIP: Cross-attention mechanism to attend to both image [batch_size, 1, 128, 128] and parameter [batch_size, param_dim] modalities.

Here's how a trained model looks like for successful image generation.
